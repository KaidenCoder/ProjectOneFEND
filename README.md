## Description

-   First project of Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

- For this project, you'll be building a portfolio website. You will be provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you must replicate that design in HTML and CSS.

- You will learn how HTML is used to define the content of a web page and start to think of every web page as a number of boxes on the screen. Youâ€™ll then learn how to position those boxes and make them beautiful using CSS.
